      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Africa's history is diverse, spanning ancient civilizations like Egypt,
        West African empires, and Indian Ocean trade. The continent experienced
        the devastating impact of the transatlantic slave trade and later
        European colonization during the 19th century. In the mid-20th century,
        African nations gained independence through political struggles. Today,
        Africa faces challenges but also shows progress in economic development,
        technology, and governance. With over 50 countries, it remains a
        continent of great potential and cultural richness.
